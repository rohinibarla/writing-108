### Self-learning

Self-learning is hard. But it is the best way to gain multiple skills. Where we decide the direction we want to go. And the things we want to learn. From childhood, someone else decides the curiculum and we just blindly follow the track layed out. When you look back and think, there are many things which are designed for masses. Anything designed for massess is generalized. Generalized stuff does not provide the necessary things that are specific to our aptitude and we miss many of the talents by keeping them latent. Only when you direct what you want to do and learn the necessary. Your latent talent become real and can be applied to the needs that you want to fulfull. Unless we direct our own learning it is very difficult to be true to our feelings and callings. We tend to follow the social trends and forget what we wanted to do. Since anything that we want to do, we need to go in a route which is less travelled. But it's normally travelled by few people. Who might not be beside us or close to us. But we can connect to them through the internet and people are kind enough to help and mentor you in these paths. People who have already seen enough life and people who by chance or by their own direction have already gone through that path and learned the necessary skills. We can reach them. We need to learn how to reach to people. For this we need to articulate what we want in the common medium of communication. Typically this tend to be email in English. So writing helps to become comfortable in expressing our thoughts in this medium. 

When it comes to coding. We read the available theory/instructions/articles/documentation and experiment with the little understanding we get and expand our understanding. Only with experimentation we can clearly understand what is right and what is wrong. And with each of the configurations and environment and systems we understand, we tend to get clarity about the whole working of the environment. With this we get confidence and our aptitude increases to try out more experiments. This feeds the virtual cycle upwards increasing our collection of skills and aptitude to experiment.
