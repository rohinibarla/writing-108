To start doing what you want to do. Like writing or reading or coding or solving a problem or fixing an issue or reaching out to people. Anything that you want to do, can be started using a trick.

The trick is to set a 21-min timmer and just commit for that period to force yourself to start doing it. Things might flow and might not flow in some occations. The key thing is sticking to the commitment that will keep on thinking or trying till the flow starts. And we are into the process of doing what we need.

The beauty of this method is that it is a short duration, which we can commit with minimal will power. Once we practice this process, we can see good results. We will be suprised to see that it is this simple to start doing what we want to do.

"Wanting to remain in the same state" looks like newtons first law. So we use this trick as external force to change the state into the needed activity rolling. Once it is rolling, it's up to us, to continue with another block of 21-mins once the timer kicks in. We can repeat till we feel to continue or we come into a state of flow where this is not needed.

This is called promodo technique. It worked for me, I feel this is useful for people who are postphoning important things from not starting. Experiment and see if it works to your type of mind.

When we can decipline of faculties like body, mind and emotion using Inner Engineering, we may not need this. Untill we get to a state where we are the master of our own faculties, we can use this trick to get into the flow.

Trick to reach goal

Count down from the end rather than from the start. Instead of start counting 1 2 3 so on.

This would help in seeing that what is left in order to succeed.

Following this I changed the articles titles from 001-ekadashi to 108-ekadashi and 002-planning to 107-planning.

This helps to see, what is left. It's different feeling from the way we do like 1, 2, 3 ... so on.
