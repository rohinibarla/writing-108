To start doing what you want to do. Like writing or reading or coding or solving a problem or fixing an issue or reaching out to people. Anything that you want to do, can be started using a trick.

The trick is to set a 21-min timmer and just commit for that period to force yourself to start doing it. Things might flow and might not flow in some occations. The key thing is sticking to the commitment that will keep on thinking or trying till the flow starts. And we are into the process of doing what we need.

The beauty of this method is that it is a short duration, which we can commit with minimal will power. Once we practice this process, we can see good results. We will be suprised to see that it is this simple to start doing what we want to do.

"Wanting to remain in the same state" looks like newtons first law. So we use this trick as external force to change the state into the needed activity rolling. Once it is rolling, it's up to us, to continue with another block of 21-mins once the timer kicks in. We can repeat till we feel to continue or we come into a state of flow where this is not needed.

This is called promodo technique. It worked for me, I feel this is useful for people who are postphoning important things from not starting. Experiment and see if it works to your type of mind.

When we can decipline of faculties like body, mind and emotion using Inner Engineering, we may not need this. Untill we get to a state where we are the master of our own faculties, we can use this trick to get into the flow.

Principle to communicate

The goal is to use an optimal way to transfer the idea/intention/bhavam from one head to another with least amount of distortion.

In order to do this, we need to first find out the common vocabulary both of us understand and use them. Vocabulary is like a naming a mental model. It's like the key to the value. So we all have some intersection between our collections of keys. 

Computer science theory is the common vocabulary that we have. We need to use them to the max extent as possible to communicate when we work or being part of interview. We can use the words like binary tree, tree height, search, sort, max. Since we all know them it does make the job easy for us in the communication process.

In real life we need to be keen at what the other person's world view is and his vocabulary is. So we could effectively communicate. User experience design(UXD) is done in the development of software artifacts. Similarly we need to do "user experience design in communication". We can take these principle from the UXD and apply them in communication. That will lead to a better communication.
