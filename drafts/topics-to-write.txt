It's the environment stupid.

Gene is the cause.
Virus is the cause.
Youtube is the cause.

People try to associate many of the health problems with genes. But in reality the environment plays an important role in enabling these genes.

You have the best genes to develop software, but you are born 5000 years ago. What's the point. It's the potential energy, unless you find an enviroment to express it you don't find the use of all the potential. 

Similarly to evade the real cause people use the genes as the primary cause of lack of education. Intead of govt doing its best to setup and continuously evolve the enviroment, it tends to find genes as the reason for people not able to study well. But if you go fact checking they impact 2% of the over all. And in that these 4 genes effect 98% percent. So it's localized effect, projected as the overall with percentages in the media created titles.

Tobocco industry try to make genes as the cause of cancer to evade the things that is being created.

Similarly viruses are used to make the world shift their attention to these and avoid the public attention from all the wrong things being done by corporates, govtments and the people with huge power, who feel less responsible for the wrong things they are intentionally doing.


Oh my child is addicted to youtube. How can I stop it? Please don't try to stop it. Instead focus on creating the enviroment in which desire to watch youtueb is reduced to minimum. You can take to beach, park, hills and many games which can make you fill with full using your body and mind. Use it or losse it applies to mind, body and everything in general. So our goal must be to create an environment and keep evolving it to make use of the child mind and body to the best. Expose to the best things that you know. Make them collectively do something or the other. Start a center for people to come and play and create some interesting stuff, what ever they like with the material available.



It's the environment stuppid.

Oh my employees are not productive. Do you create an evironment for the developers to focus with undisturbed continuos chunks of long time like 4-8 hours of continuos time blocks for them to work? Better work on the enviroment than trying to fix it.

Oh my mind is not doing what I want. Don't control the mind. Start commiting to things and start executing the things. See what environment you have created arround. Try to understand it's effect and make the environment such that it helps in doing the things that you wanted to do with less friction and to do things that you don't want to as much friction as needed, try to add it. It must very hard to do the things that you don't want to do.

Hmm I am not finding good developers for my startup in Vizag. It's the environment stupid. What is the environment you are providing. Now we have remote option as well. You want a fool to experiment with you by spending his time, then there must be something very good thing which is intangable must be able to be achived for him. Which he needs to understand the value of it. Otherwise, you are not doing your best job is what is felt. If you are full time and dedicated to create what you wanted. Work with the things you have. do what you can. Remote, colleges and other things. You have to work hard. There is no free lunch. Someone is feeding on behalf of you.


----

Planning, acheiving and many other things.

----

Constant effort habit is success

Anything you want to achive, you need to have a sustained effort and urgency must be there. 

Either it's money or anything work on it consitently.
