Planning, acheiving and many other things.

----


Simple solutions can be found, and use the other good things available. These might be called workarounds, for the limitations. 

----

Compounds used for destruction of life.
Like gamesin for ants.
Pesticide for pests.

How are these created?
Why are these created?
What is the history for this creation?
Concentration camps of Germany?
Poisnous gases?
Dangorous chemicals?

There are some usefulness while there is lot of residual waste which is dangerous. All the polution of industrial waste is just the treatment of compounds with chemicals, to produce somethings useful to people and leave out a dangerous resudual.

How does nature does the same?
It too have some poisionous compounds.
Imbalance of the gases can cause death. Nature does the balance of Oxygena and Carbandioxite, with two parts doing the magic in sync. 

Can we design models where the output compounds, chemicals, gases are inputs for other model, which feedback into the first one. Like a loop, similar to the plants and people breathing and needed exact opposite types of gases.


Permaculture folks covert human waste in manuaer and use them for the plants, which they inturn consume. We use chemcals, bleaches and other to clean all this stuff and mix it with the ocean and rivers. We disturb the balance. Findig out these balancing models, process and cultural change activities can change our behaviour for the better.

We break the balance, by producing to many animal farming and producing the residual waste, which is becoming problamatic.

Fish is fed to chicken, chicken waste is fed to fish. If their is shit shared like that it would be interesting. But here after they are killed, the waste is used between the two.

Balance, balance, balance... Seems the way. What we doing in an imbalanced way. To start with what we have in our hands. Our body (including mind) which is going out of balance, because of the type inputs that we give and the type of identification that we associate with.

Once we have balanced body-mind, we can act balanced and bring out balanced solutions in the world. It's because of the compulsive nature of ours, with out having a balanced thought, we take wrong decisions and create impalances in the world.

The chemicals does not disintegrate. We should be minimizing the use of the compounds which cannot disintegrate. Earth is capable of disintegrating many things. Then why does it find it hard to decompose the chemicals. Artificial substabces.

Now an important question for producers is... will earth able to disintegrate this product easily? What will help in doing that. When we have this solution of this, we can keep producing products. First check for allowing a product to be used might be this. Before asking if its usefull or not. Taking this question as a binary decider to allow produce products will be best direction human kind should follow. In a hurry we creae lot of things which does not disintegrate well in the earth.
