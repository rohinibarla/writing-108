### Self-learning

Self-learning is hard. But it is the best way to gain multiple skills. Where we decide the direction we want to go. And the things we want to learn. From childhood, someone else decides the curiculum and we just blindly follow the track layed out. When you look back and think, there are many things which are designed for masses. Anything designed for massess is generalized. Generalized stuff does not provide the necessary things that are specific to our aptitude and we miss many of the talents by keeping them latent. Only when you direct what you want to do and learn the necessary. Your latent talent become real and can be applied to the needs that you want to fulfull. Unless we direct our own learning it is very difficult to be true to our feelings and callings. We tend to follow the social trends and forget what we wanted to do. Since anything that we want to do, we need to go in a route which is less travelled. But it's normally travelled by few people. Who might not be beside us or close to us. But we can connect to them through the internet and people are kind enough to help and mentor you in these paths. People who have already seen enough life and people who by chance or by their own direction have already gone through that path and learned the necessary skills. We can reach them. We need to learn how to reach to people. For this we need to articulate what we want in the common medium of communication. Typically this tend to be email in English. So writing helps to become comfortable in expressing our thoughts in this medium. 

When it comes to coding. We read the available theory/instructions/articles/documentation and experiment with the little understanding we get and expand our understanding. Only with experimentation we can clearly understand what is right and what is wrong. And with each of the configurations and environment and systems we understand, we tend to get clarity about the whole working of the environment. With this we get confidence and our aptitude increases to try out more experiments. This feeds the virtual cycle upwards increasing our collection of skills and aptitude to experiment.

Gynacologist's role for a better world

There are many practices that used to be followed by conceived women in ancient days. These practices were bought after careful observation of how human system is build starting from the 2 cells.

They say that the life enters between 42-48 days into the womb. What does life entering into the body means? Why does it take 9 months? How many months does it take for a cow, monkey and other earthlings? Because of the Earth, Moon & Sun we have these forms. Are they also influencing on the duration of 9 months? 

Definetly the mother's body, mind, emotions, energy and environment around her influences the growth of the baby. What are different mechanisms to keep these five things in optimal state for the best growth of the baby.

Even the sounds around influence the baby. What type of sounds are best for the baby?

Ancient times based on our climate conditions they suggested to have specific food. What are the reasons for it? Can we digg into different sources and understand the reasons and bring back the practices which makes sense in today's context.

SSY conducts programs for mothers and fathers during this period. Isha also have a program for women during this period. What do they do in their programs. What are the effect due these practices that are suggested? Can we dig deeper and understand their reasoning behind. At the minimum can we clearly capture the practices that are suggested. Staying in concecreated spaces will surely help. Where are concecrated spaces around us and how can we create such spaces? 

Just comming few years before and reading some books does not make something into great and arrogant beings. We bully the kids, but are also full fledged life just like us. Just that we are ahead in the line to be born and to be dead. 

All these wonderful practices not part of the prescription of medicines. But surely suggesting the right practices and the care for the baby inside the womb by the doctor is a sure sign of respect and responsibility on the future generation.

In this rat race environment, does the doctor have time to even take an extra breath to relax. No. But these working lifestyles are created unknowingly or accepted as given. Even in this rat race, if it's you getting ahead of other doctors. It's time you care your best for the child in you visiting moms' womb. Which will surely send the right signal to the parents and they will queue outside your clinic, for your care. If you just care only for the number of trasactions made, than what to say? Only to wish you all the best for having a better version rat like life.
