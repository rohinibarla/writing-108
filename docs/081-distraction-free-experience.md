### Distraction-free experience

Writing using the Bear App on macOS is the most beautiful experience.

Many of the editors provide a distraction-free writing experience. For example, Sublime, VSCode, Xcode. I think almost all the latest software with editors as a component, provide these experience. 

The code editors are also offering these experiences to write down just the code. It’s a beautiful place when we are comfortable writing the code in the language. When we juggle between multiple files, the file explorer tab might be needed. 

Some new IDEs broke these limitations of representing all the code using files. Source code is a collection of functions. It’s tough to imagine these things as we are habituated to build everything related to code based on the foundations of the file system. 

But when we move to that place where the limitations of the file structure are not present, it would be interesting. The Light Table Application tries to do that. For this, we need to have new languages that do not think of their code organization as a collection of files. The language needs to support this and then the editor needs to support this. The compiler, by default, assumes the source will be part of some files. 

The text that is part of the code can be a single file, but how do we organize and navigate between different pieces of code in the code base, has to be designed. The tools that support the software life cycle like the git, CI and other tools are all based on files, how do they change. 

The source code is based on files (assumption/knowledge) is taken for granted by every tool in the toolchain that creates and maintains the software.
