### Involving student

When we want to impact people, we thing teaching them and showing them the best paths to achieve their desires in the best ways. But at any given time, students have a lot of things to involve in. Can we make them involved in the process of becoming skillful in the paths that lead to their desired goal?

For example, I take classes every Thursday for 1st year B.Tech students, to show them the big picture of software development domain. I meet a section of the student every two weeks. That means I meet them twice per month. The gap is enormous when compared to the regular faculty who interact with them daily or alternative days at the least.

But whether we teach them the best way in the class or not, when we can engage them and involve them in experimenting environments which allow them to express. And in the process, learn the art of doing things. So we have to do the necessary tasks to involve them in the activity of trying out to build different software projects.

The end goal is to make them sit before a system and keep trying to get their creation working, which gives enormous confidence and the necessary needed skill to solve the problems in the working environment. Where they are alone with a system and ecosystem to help when asked after doing their re-search.

Let's see what we can do.
