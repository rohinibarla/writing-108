### Brushing teeth causes gastritis?

When we brush our teeth in the morning, we use sweet pastes. These pastes contain sugar. When we put this paste into our mouth, our tongue signals that we started eating, and the gastric juices get started releasing by the liver.   
  
You must have observed that, unless you brush your teeth, you don't feel hungry. Even though it's late, the moment you brush your teeth, you start feeling hungry.    
  
To avoid this, some days, I tried to do yoga without brushing my teeth as it is producing some gas in the empty stomach. I need to observe more and see what the best way to do is.  
  
When we use neem stick or babul stick for brushing our teeth, they don't produce such effects. Or when we use salt and charcoal combination to create a powder to clean our teeth.  
    
I guess this might have happened, something like this. In western countries, they usually did not use to clean their teeth. So they started creating these chemicals to be used to clean the teeth after eating. So these were designed to be cleaned after eating. But due to the marketing, they were being used early in the morning. Which is causing this trouble is my guess.  
  
Similarly, the patients with diabetics, who go for a blood test early in the morning before taking breakfast, generally tend to clean their mouth with these pastes and go. In a way, they are adding some sugar to the readings.  
  
These are all some guesses with the observations I have done. I just now brushed my teeth with a paste and writing this article. I will observe what it will be like with a new approach. I am feeling to go neem stick route. It's just the inertia that is keeping in this default path.
