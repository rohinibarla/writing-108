### Impressions

The impressions of all the past lifes are with us. This is what is stated by all the realized being. Let’s assume it’s the truth for this analysis. 

So a person dies in the physical form, but all the impressions are carried along. We use the word life as from birth to death. So these birth and death are physical markers. But these impressions are being carried along. Because of this, we call them past life’s memory.   

But in reality, it is all along with a single life, in multiple shells. We might have named the shell as life because of our limitations with our perception. So there might not be multiple lifes. Just a single one.  

The vocabulary is limiting. We must not start with vocabulary to think. Think about it and then try to express in the limited vocabulary created by limited perception. In Sanskrit, they never name anything. They just try to describe the qualities of everything that they speak about. In our perception, people might be dead. But in reality, they are very well intact with all the impressions. We all have the impressions of our past lifes.
