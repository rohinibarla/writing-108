### AUM 
AUM sound is the universal sound. It resonates in your body. If we had the right instruments, we could hear it. 

AUM chant is typically done for 21 times or 108 times. When we utter this sound, there are vibrations felt in different parts of the body. This sound and vibrations remind the cells in the body that this body is mortal.

Aaa, Uuuu and Mmmm are the sounds that can be produced without using the tongue. 

These individual sounds are also used for benefits in Yoga and Ayurveda. These chants of just Aaaa and others are suggested as part of Ayurveda to rejuvenate a particular Chakra in our body. Chakra’s are like junction points where the energy pathways in our energy body meet. 

When you practice AUM chanting for 21 times every day. Your mind becomes calm with clarity. Give it a try and see. Do it for a week and see if there is any difference.

This sound has been modified into OM in my culture. Or there might be different effects of AUM and OM, which I don’t know.
