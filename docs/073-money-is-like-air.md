### Money is like air

How do we use air? We breathe in and breathe out. There is a constant exchange of air. If we think air is useful and start collecting it and not using it as much needed for breathing, we might become sick. And later there is no use of having it, once you become week. You might try to use more air. But there is a limit to it. You can not even breathe to normal capacity. 

Instead, the best thing you can do is to create an environment where fresh air is generated. You plant trees around, take care of the things that will help you get fresh air. Your goal is to create and maintain an environment that could provide abundant fresh, pure air.

The same goes for money. Money is just like air. No point in hoarding it. It’s a mechanism to exchange. It’s a means to fulfill our desire. Our desire mostly revolves around being happy. 

So try to create and nurture an environment that provides constant fresh money. So you could use the money to create wealth, which in turn provides you with an abundance of money.

Money and wealth are different. Wealth generates money continuously.
