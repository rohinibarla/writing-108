### Good lead time

A group of friends come together and start building things, which are useful to people. All it takes is a small amount to survive for a brief period. I have seen this twice in 2001 and 2008. Nothing to worry. Why this happened just when I completed my studies. From what I have seen, all capable people have settled in excellent jobs eventually. It takes some time. It’s a brief period of 2-3 years, it might look disappointing. Later the tide raises. You have to be well prepared for this.   

With the current infrastructure and facilities and support, you could easily create a thriving company in this period. If you are entrepreneurs and not able to get parent permission, this is the best time. The environment is well set for you to experiment and explore what you have always wanted to do. The other beauty is useless things are not entertained, so you will move fast to create a software that people want in these times. The times are good.  

Earlier times, it took time to realize that the recession has occurred. By the time you know you are already in the receiving end because you know after 6-9 months after it has happened. And people confuse by arguing that we are not yet in recession and so on. These are recessions that come gradually and it’s challenging to realize, are we on the downward path of the economy on it is just a small dip.  

This time we know ahead that recession has occurred now. We came to know quickly. And it’s not localized to some country in the globe. It’s across the world. So we have enough time to plan and execute accordingly. For the people who will graduate in the year 2021, this is even best for them, since they have good lead time to work towards what they wanted.  

Want could happen to all the people who are campus placed right now. Companies can do multiple things. Some will say we cannot forget the job offers that we gave. Some companies will onboard you after one or two years. This is what happened to my seniors with the Wipro company. Very few companies on board irrespective of the recession like TCS, which did for our seniors in 2001.  

This is also time to be open-minded and pay keen attention to remote work and local development opportunities that arise. Just put your antennas on for opportunities.
