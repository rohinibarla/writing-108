### Pushing the boundaries

Learning Sanskrit. Playing with colors on the canvas. Stretching your body early in the morning. Keeping your feet in contact with the earth and the sea. Doing yoga kriya. 

All these activities 
+ do not burn your pocket but burn fat in your body. 
+ do not reduce your time but reduce your sleep time.
+ do not reduce your mindshare but sharpen your mind. 
+ do not exhaust your energy but push your energy to the higher levels.

Starting with a long stretch will hurt you and make you lose your interest in these activities. So start small, and keep pushing and adding new things. In a way pushing the boundaries one step at a time. The size of the step is the maximum optimal length, which does not hurt you.
