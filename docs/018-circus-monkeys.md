### Circus monkeys
  
It is not the time that is ticking away; it is our life. So we spend our life doing things, with a goal in mind. From childhood, we are told, if you do this, you will get this. And the story has repeated at some transition points like 10th, Inter, Graduation and Job. Now we started to think, ok, if I do this, what will I get. Or to get that, what should I do. We have become goal-oriented. Just like the monkey in the circus doing all the needed action. Just to get the banana or the food at the end. We are like Circus monkeys.  
  
Once we zoom out and see 
+ What are we doing? 
+ For what are we doing?
+ How are we doing?
+ How it permeates our experience of life?
  
Once we think through these, we might realize we can do better. Or it's best to do nothing for my circumstances. Instead of oriented to a goal, figure out what is needed and simply do it. In the process, you get many things which you could enjoy.  
  
This goal-oriented process has created everlasting need to be happy. Until you achieve the goal, you look like a failure. Once you achieve, you get onto a new goal. So the majority of the time, you feel like a failure. Instead, why don't we create a process where the journey becomes joyful and you also keep getting rewarded. (Gamanamey Gamyamayithey) Once the journey becomes the destination, you are liberated from the stupid struggle that you endow upon yourself.
