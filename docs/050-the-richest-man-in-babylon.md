### Completed Book: The Richest Man in Babylon

When I saw the physical book with my brother. It's a small book. I have heard about this book. I already had a soft copy. I just tried to read the starting of the book. I like it.  

I declared that I will complete this book by the end of today. But that end of today did not come in the last two days. I could not read the book in one go, but I was just on it for three days and completed the book today.  

I really liked the book. I hope I had studied it when I was in my twenties. Just before or as I started earning. That would really be the right time. Before that, it would be mostly theory and hard to stick in mind. But when a person starts earning his first rupee, he has to read this book. This is my recommendation.  

As part of our education, we don't talk anything about money. About how to use and manage money. But today's education focus is all about how to do something to get a large amount of money. It's like Abhimanya's education, only half-knowledge of Padhmavyuham.  

It's so ironic.  

You can always keep part of the money you earned for yourself. What it gives you is confidence.  

Are you a slave or a free man? It's about what is your attitude? This question is worth asking yourself.
