### Goal-oriented habits
  
The purpose of writing every day for 108 days, is to follow a process of writing every day for say 21 mins. Now after not writing for many days, in the last 2 months. Now trying to write as many articles as possible, to make sure by the end of 108 days, I complete all the backlog articles.  
  
In this mindset of somehow get all the 108 completed by the last day. Due to this somehow, attitude thought of shortcuts, how that could be done in a short time. One brilliant idea was to write about people that I admire. In the processes of finishing out fast, writing about these people quickly, lead to writing very shallowly. The reader can't understand why this person is great. All these articles go like, this person does great work, and his perspective is this. Go and see this talk and that talk, you will find why he is so great. It's like an article with a few pointers to finding out actually what he does.  
  
Last few days, I have been writing 3-4 articles daily to somehow complete. Yesterday I realized I have converted this process-oriented activity into a goal-oriented activity.  
  
Ok, by the time of 108 days, if you complete, you feel successful. Even if you write 80 or 90 or 105 articles, you think as a failure. Am I submitting these articles to someone as an assignment? Should I show these to people and boost that I have written these many articles? Why am I cramping all these articles in a hurry? Why should I always feel failure, for putting this much effort and the last moments putting lots of energy? Doing all this work and feeling a failure, just in my mind. This mode of thing is so ingrained in the brain that it takes continuous conscious efforts to come out of these wrong mental models of reality in our mind.  
  
I have realized that what all stupid things I do with a goal-oriented mindset. Somehow achieve it. When you somehow make it, you internally feel that you took all these shortcuts and that has a nagging feeling internally. But we have reached the goal, so what, it still feels shallow achievement.  
  
Why do we create all these stupid mental models to feel failure most of the time and feel virtual stress? All this is self-created.  
  
Today's success is the result of many steps that we took in the past. Doing today's work to our best will become a step for future success. With the process, your focus is on today and now. What have you done today? What are you doing now? With the process, just focus on today. If that is not happing, fix it today. We should not try to fix the past days missed work, with today's time.  
  
Finally felt like, it's ok, let it take more days, write daily an article every day. Just make sure you write one today. I am clear in my head that this will lead to the best things that I could create. And I will feel joyful in creating these on a daily basis.  
  
Rest In Peace, goal-oriented habits.
