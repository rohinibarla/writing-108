### Distributed Dev
  
In a sense, when we have all the developers distributed across the country. Where companies have the majority of their employees working remotely. Now when people get salaries, they spend in the area they live in. Some people will spend on Agriculture or small businesses in their town. The well-educated people are there in all the communities, like towns, villages. Instead of migrating to cities for jobs. They get a remote job settle in their home town. This will keep the most capable people of the village in the village. Leading to the development of the village in many different ways. Primarily as easy access to youngsters, little children. Developing their own locality is inbuilt in all human beings.  
  
Now communities can focus on building capable people in the locality since they will stay here for life and things are building over generations.  
  
The future is looking good, people have the opportunity of living in clean air, no unnecessary commute.  
  
Which all leads to a distributed development across Bharat.  
  
Now that TCS has announced that 3 lacks of employees will work remotely. As other companies like Wipro and Infosys also follow this. It will be a balanced way of living on earth.
