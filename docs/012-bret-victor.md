He is an independent thinker. Every Computer Science student must study his work. The papers he has put on his personal website must be reviewed and discussed in a group.  
  
I would prefer to add some papers in the study group that I create.  
  
I got the right perspective on teaching, from his article. So true, and which clearly states that people must be practicing or using what they have been teaching. It's like real professionals working must teach.  
  
I got a perspective of the history of computing and came to know the great people's work in history.  
  
His presentations are eye-openers. Many of the IDE developers have inspired from his talk and added features of live coding in the tools. Swift language has come up with Playgrounds, inspired by his talk. Explorables is another site which is inspired by his work.  
  
The power of a computer is simulation and visualization, which is not used to the fullest potential.  
  
We all code with blindfolds on, like a Gandhari.  
  
Why should we still think like a computer rather than telling the computer what to do and it does it?  
I have been following his journey after leaving Apple, Push Pop Press and Dynamicland.  
  
Understanding his Dynamicland will lead to a different understanding of what computing can do.
