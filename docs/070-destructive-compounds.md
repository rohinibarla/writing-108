### Destructive compounds

Compounds used for destruction of life.  
Like Gameshin for ants.  
Pesticide for pests.  
  
How are these created?  
Why are these created?  
What is the history of this creation?  
Concentration camps of Germany?  
Poisonous gases?  
Dangerous chemicals?  
  
There is some usefulness while there is a lot of residual waste, which is dangerous. All the pollution of industrial waste is just the treatment of compounds with chemicals, to produce something useful to people and leave out a hazardous residue.  
  
How does nature do the same?  
It, too, has some poisonous compounds.  
Imbalance of the gases can cause death. Nature does the balance of Oxygen and Carbandioxite, with two parts doing the magic in sync.   
  
Can we design models where the output compounds, chemicals, gases are inputs for other models, which feedback into the first one? Like a loop, similar to the plants and people breathing and needed exact opposite types of gases.  
  
Permaculture folks covert human waste into manure and use them for the plants, which they, in turn, consume. We use chemicals, bleaches and other to clean all this stuff and mix it with the ocean and rivers. We disturb the balance. Finding out these balancing models, process and cultural change activities can change our behavior for the better.  
  
We break the balance by producing too many animal farming and producing residual waste, which is becoming problematic.  
  
Fish is fed to chicken, chicken waste is fed to fish. If there is shit shared like that, it would be interesting. But after they are killed, the waste is used between the two.  
  
Balance, balance, balance... It seems the way. What we are doing in an imbalanced way. To start with what we have in our hands. Our body (including mind) which is going out of balance. Because of the type of inputs that we give and the type of identification that we associate with.  
  
Once we have balanced body-mind, we can act balanced and bring out balanced solutions in the world. It's because of the compulsive nature of ours, without having a balanced thought, we take wrong decisions and create imbalances in the world.  
  
The chemicals do not disintegrate. We should be minimizing the use of the compounds which cannot disintegrate. Earth is capable of disintegrating many things. Then why does it find it hard to decompose the chemicals? Artificial substances.  
  
Now an important question for producers is... will earth able to disintegrate this product quickly? What will help in doing that? When we have this solution to this, we can keep producing products. The first check for allowing a product to be used might be this. Before asking if it is useful or not. Taking this question as a binary decider to allow produce products will be the best direction humankind should follow. In a hurry, we create a lot of things that do not disintegrate well on the earth.
