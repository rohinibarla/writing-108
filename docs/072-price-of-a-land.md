# Price of a land
When I saw a small piece of land, 200 Gajalu, and it costs more than 1 or 2 crores. The question I have is why does it cost so much? What makes the price rise. Earlier it cost 20 lacks. So is it demand? People say it costs so and so and when I want to sell there are enough people to buy it for the same price, it means people have perceived value. How do they perceive value? A lot of people perceiving the equal or more value, makes all the price hikes work.  

But why do people perceive value this much? How to get the value out of it. If not by sealing it to the people, how else this perceived value is reasonable to make use of? How do I create value by converting this area into what? When I cultivate something regularly, I get some value out of it. But otherwise what people do with land to get the value of it?  

Gold is also perceived as valuable. If no one values it to buy from you, then the perceived value is less. If such is the case when everyone does not value this gold. Do people still prefer to buy gold ornaments?
