### First 15 mins

The first 15 minutes of your working time must be spent on thinking about and planning about the work that you care for. For example, you are running a business. Every day 15 min you spend on how can I improve the business? Just answering the question every day as a ritual, will be the best thing to do.  
  
For me, I have done yoga kriya. I started my working time. My current question I want to answer in the first 15 mins isâ€¦ how to earn money? What are the different ways? The routine jobs which I was doing are not available now. It has been a month we have been at home only.  
  
I want to actively work and create wealth. Meeting both the financial needs and creating wealth.  
  
If you are interested in your child's future, primarily their education. You could spend 15 mins daily, thinking about how can it be improved? Or weekly 15 mins is also a good start if you are feeling overwhelmed to start doing anything extra daily. Many people work hard to earn money. And give the wealth to their children, but what if you spend 15 mins thinking about how to make them learn something which is constant and is useful irrespective of times. Like the discipline of their faculties, planning, self-directed learning and doing, working in teams. Exploring new things. Whatever you want in your child's behavior, most of them you must lead with your behavior. So its more work to do to see a change in your child.  
   
When you can work for 15 mins daily, your life will be changed in the direction you want it to be.
