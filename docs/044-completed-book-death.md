### Completed book: Death

Completed Death book in one cycle of the moon.   

The book was released on Shivarathri. Got the book 4 days later. Yesterday was Ugadi. I completed the book today. This is the book that I have read in such a short time in my life. Every day after Shambhavi kriya, read a few pages. This is the time where the mind is still. Pleasantness is spread across both physical and psychological.   

In the last 3 days felt like I want to complete this book in one day. But could not complete, it took 4 days to complete. With this corona news, I made myself like half dead. Going through all the news and sleeping most of the time. But doing Shambhavi for the last two days and completing this book, gave a sense of pleasantness.   

These things like 
- one cycle of the moon
- Shivarathri
- Ugadi

Are all based on the cycles of the moon and very much related to our life on earth.   

I asked my friend to order this book. I did not still pay the amount. I will pay him now :-)  

This book is for everyone who shall die...
