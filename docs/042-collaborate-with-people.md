### Collaborate with people

When you get a request to do some work and you are not able to handle it alone. You can do some part of it but not completely. You generally tend to say, it’s not feasible and refers to someone who could do the same.   

It’s best if you could find someone with whom you can collaborate and do the work. Always team up with the people you trust and you have respect for their capabilities.   

When you see an opportunity that you like, but you cannot execute it entirely on your own. Try out all the possibilities of collaboration with different people add to see how you can utilize the opportunity.  Don’t always think that I am alone, I can only do these small size things. Start doing more significant ideas with collaboration.  

When you carefully pay attention, there is, for sure, an element of collaboration in successful activities, without which it might not be feasible to achieve success in such activities.
