### Dream with meditators

People are searching for missing people. In a family, their grandson Surya was missing. 

His mother, Savithri, who went in search of him, did not return, she was also missing. Later her husband Shravan went in search of Surya and Savithri, leaving his parents and daughter Soumya at home.

But after 2 days neither of them returned home. Soumya got worried and thought to give a complaint at the police station. They used to live in a village, with a lot of hills around. Soumya, along with her grandparents, started to reach the police station by walk.

After walking a few hours, they saw a temple on a hill. They all prayed for their missed ones. On top of the hill, there are three small temple-like structures. Just like three small garbha-gudis (place in the temple where murthi is placed). They were placed such that anyone sitting in one cannot see the other two.

It happened like this first the son Surya sat in one of the temples and went into deep meditation. Next, Savithri did namaskaram to the other two temples and sat inside the second temple and went into deep meditation. Next, Shravan did namaskaram to the other two temples and sat inside the third temple and went into deep meditation. They all just saw from the outside. Savithri and Shravan did not know that their dear ones are meditating inside.

What happened next... I woke up from this dream today.
