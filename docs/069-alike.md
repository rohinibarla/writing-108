### Alike
The short film Alike is a beautiful depiction of the processes we created as a society to make everyone alike. The subtle things the shortfall depicts very well. The little one starts with jumping but slowly shows his hands to put the bag. The color blue is used to show that the father is pleasant. His body color pales out and the film shows moments that bring back the pleasantness into his body. 

To represent that the father gets an idea is a ting sound, and a blank screen following it.

We feel sorry for the state of the child, the father puts his work aside and starts playing the instrument, virtually. The people around look with weird faces. What happened to this guy?  Instead of going to work, why is he doing like this. The child jumps and becomes alive. In the foreground, another child with a lifeless poster is going to school and elders with the lifeless way they walk to the work. We understand this. But we still leave them to defaults of the processes around us. Can’t we do anything? At least, can’t you do anything?

This is so close to my feelings. I have felt all these feelings in my life but left my child in the default path. I have seen this earlier, and again now. But what’s the use of knowing when you can’t apply it? 

We want to be unique, but we design and plan our lives to be alike. The same goes for our children, we want them to be unique, but we put into a process which outputs all alike.
