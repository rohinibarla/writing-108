# Constant effort 

Whatever you do, if you are doing something that you wanted to do, on a constant basis. You can call yourself successful. **Constant effort habit is success**.

Anything you want to achieve, you need to have a sustained effort, and urgency must be there. A continuous effort over a long period will yield the gains of compound interest. 

For example, you invest in the stock market every month and put a constant effort to make sure you have a 15% gain every year. Over the years, it will compound into a decent amount.

For example, you want to be better at coding, daily if you spend writing bad-code for the next one year. The reason for saying bad-code, it allows your mind to flow without restrictions when you set the standard low. The change that you can see is remarkable. I need to try a similar one like solving one problem every day. i.e., Writing code for a problem every day for some 1024 days. That will surely set apart from the current state of coding level. Or, if not daily, weekly twice/trice solve three problems every week. Once you complete 108 weeks, it's around 2+ years. The results will be tremendous.

For example, you practice your favorite yoga kriya daily. The results will be tremendous when you can sustain for long periods.

Many businesses need you to be sustained for a more extended period to see success like restaurants, training institutes.

Either it's money or anything that you want, work on it consistently.
