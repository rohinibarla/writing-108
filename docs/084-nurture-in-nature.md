### Nurture in nature

Why should fresh graduates live in congested spaces like Ameerpet hostels and live in polluted cities to get trained for the jobs?

Why don’t we expose them to beautiful landscapes in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and make them better at becoming software engineers?

The model of AltCampus is just the way I like it to be. Can’t we create such spaces with next-generation people who can do that?

Life in hills and freshwater around, with connectivity, is the best experience they could get. After being locked in the classrooms for decades-long, when they could experience nature in its best way. It would not be better than that. 

It’s interestingly supper.
