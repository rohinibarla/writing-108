### What do I teach? 

I donâ€™t teach. Period.

I create an environment in which the students bring their ideas to life by creating software. My whole effort is to create this environment. Where he could devise his own direction and works towards achieving the needed capability to walk in that direction.

It confuses people because I am using the same medium created for teaching, as part of creating this environment.

I imagine a beautiful scene in which a bunch of young people comes together. Work on solving a problem they like. Experiment and create new things for fun and play. And share their creation with the world. They earn decently to meet their needs. They are an excited, enthusiastic and capable bunch of people.
