### I don't know

> I don't know,  
> let's collaborate.  
  
When we interact with young people(students) when they ask a question, and we don't know, we need to say, "I don't know, let's collaborate." And commit to it.  
  
When we say this and collectively explore and find the answer, we help them to understand the process that we follow to explore new things and how we find out the right information needed. And how we conclude that this is authentic information and which is not. Saying this will also give them the confidence to explore new things on there own when they hit an area of unknown.  

Saying "I don't know, let's collaborate" is more important for the teacher to practice with their students. Let me do it with my students.
