### Sadhana

Sadhana is a way of cleaning the system. When you do Sadhana regularly, you keep it clean. What does one accumulate with the time that is cleaned by Sadhana? How can we minimize the accumulation? Is there a way to not accumulate at all?  

This body is a collection of cells. These cells are created with the recent food that we eat. A lot of cells die every day. As a human being, I am a combination of cells, bacteria and viruses.  

We have eaten(consumed) a lot of food, water, air and fire/sun-light/energy from pre-birth(conception) till now. Let us call all of these we consume to survive as food. The body that we have is the collection of recently consumed food.  

We are somewhat opposite of what plants do. Plants take filth, water, air and transform them into packages of grains, fruits and vegetables. We take these grains, fruits and vegetables, water, air and transform into filth, dead skin(including hair, nails).  

The mental body is a collection of all inputs from the senses, from the moment when I could record them. Both the food body and the mental body are collections. Both these collections are mine. Mental body collection keeps on accumulating. The food body is a collection of the recent quarter and recent year's consumption. It’s ever-updating. Memory is accumulation limited by time, but not capacity.  

 The moment we drop these two bodies, what happens next don’t know. But till that moment arrives, we can do Sadhana to keep these two bodies in the lap of pleasantness.  

Most of the things I don’t know. I know too little. Stillness is beautiful since it is the peak of pleasantness that I have experienced.
