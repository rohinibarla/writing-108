What is the truth? You have to think for yourself. Start with these truths and keep building your mental models and guiding principles to navigate the day to day decisions with ease.

A principle is a guiding thought, which is formed after observation of repeating situations and learning what is the right pattern to follow in a similar situation in the future.

For example, here is a principle I thought of using it from today - Always discuss money-matters in person only.

Keep observing and creating your guiding principles to make life easy. With these templates collection, you save a lot of mental energy to make decisions and avoid repeating the same mistakes.
