# A pleasant developer experience

Clearly define what needs to be done. Ways to verify that its complete. Any issues are listed immediately. Design + Dev + Test are done in parallel for a small piece of work. Overall product execution.

Team leads need to shape the work. Read ShapeUp.

Getting real, what can be used from it.

The practice that helps is writing whatâ€™s done in detail for someone interested to read.

Do they use basecamp for all client communication? Or any other tool.
Communication using emails, it is hard to see what is committed to being delivered.

Clearly defining what is needed to be done. Write code, run the tests, and commit the changes.

Clearly seeing the product end to end by the team lead. And planning out things for people to develop. Asking and knowing what details are missing for the new developer.

Task, sub-tasks. Dev, verify, [review, change, verify], commit.
