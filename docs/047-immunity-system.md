### Immunity system

Is there a way to measure the strength of the immunity system of a person? Is there any standard created already? No, it does not exists. We know about immune deficiencies and autoimmune diseases.  We can only measure what is not present, we cannot tell if something is healthy, we can only say if something is unhealthy, i.e., disease. We are focused on disease. Who is interested in creating standards to measure the immunity systems and defining health.   

But there exists a method to assess your immune system strength. It's in BMMB era. That is before modern medicine was born.  

It's Vatha, Pitha and Kapha ratio of 1:1:1. VPK balance at all levels tells you that you at your best immune system. Ayurvedha just tries to balance these three parameters in our body at multiple levels.  

The food is quantified using this standard. It's just not limited to the food. The six seasons are also quantified using this standard, how it could affect our body. So they even consider the environment and food we intake. They even suggest different yogic practices and exercises for improving the immune system.  

The food and environment are mentioned as a glossary in Medicine textbooks.  

Ironically, Ayurvedha is studied with enthusiasm and used in other places than in its birthplace.
