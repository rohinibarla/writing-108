### FPO and consumers
  
Farmers Producer Organizations are like co-operative societies formed for collective good. The land owned by each farmer has become smaller parcels these days. So doing irrigation and selling the produce is costing a lot. So when they collectively form FPO, they could together do irrigation, or at the minimum, they will have collective selling power. Because now they will have a variety of food to serve the customer.  
  
Now there are few organic FPOs in every district. And there are many organic stores in every neighborhood. The organic store maintenance cost depends on the location of the store and staff. To make it sustainable and profitable, the organic store owner tries to procure the food from whoever delivers it for a lower cost. Food processing units also do the same. You get it from where it costs less and also have a brand value. This leads to a peculiar situation where FPOs sell to far distant customers and organic stores also procure from far distant FPOs than the local ones.  
  
Due to lockdown these days. Stores and Processing units are not able to get the needed food items. FPOs, on the other hand, are now not able to sell their produce.  
  
Initially, an idea to solve this problem was to connect local producers and sellers. But it turns out to be not a solution in reality. When you try to connect them to the local organic stores, the prices are not acceptable to the stores since the margin gets reduced and may not be sustainable.  
  
FPOs are ready to deliver the food items to any place in the local area around 80 km. But they need a minimum order, which could be taken. So if a group of people from a location come together and order, they could serve. And it would be beneficial for both since the food items are fresh and reasonable cost. The number of people who could afford organic food has been increasing. Now at least if they understand that eating organic food is the right in the direction of improving immunity, they might consider it.  
  
We need to think and see how we can solve this problem. Ironically many of the organic FPOs produce is sold to Europe and other countries. Why don't we provide the necessary cost and consume it here itself? It reduces lots of transportation costs and saves the environment and nature.
