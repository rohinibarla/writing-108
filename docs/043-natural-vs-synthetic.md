### Natural vs. Synthetic

There are some misleading words used by modern medicine practitioners who are convinced of scientific fervor. For example, when you talk about Kashayam of let say Guava leaves (jamaakulu). Any MBBS holder will say it's a crude form of medicine. Whereas the drugs they provide are pure or precise forms. When you say the same thing like this...  

The Kashayam is a natural form, whereas the medicines are of the synthetic reductionist form. With Kashayam, you treat the body as a system in the natural style. In contrast, modern medicine is you build a model based on Newtonian physics, as a collection of cause and effect.  

The natural form strengthens the immune system and facilitates the natural process in our body to fix the root cause of the problems. Whereas these synthetic forms of medicines try to fix the symptoms. Which they blindly believe as if it is the best way of solving a problem in the human body.  

Next time carefully observe these words used by these MBBS doctors like...  
When they refer to the practices of other ways of treatments and the medicines used in the different other streams of medicine.  

Do they really know what all the things Kashayam contains are? What are the other minute quantities, which, in combination with the primary component, supports this recovery?  

It's like mineral water vs. natural water. You remove everything and add minerals. Can you add all the quantities of varieties of minerals present in natural water? I hope they have a thinking mind.
