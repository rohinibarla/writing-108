### Trick to achieve a goal

Count down from the end rather than from the start. Instead of start counting 1 2 3 so on.

This would help in seeing what is left to succeed.

Following this, I changed the titles of the articles for my *writing 108 days challenge*. Earlier I named the first and second article as 001-ekadashi and 002-planning.  
  
Now using this trick I renamed the article URLs as 
001-ekadashi to 108-ekadashi and 002-planning to 107-planning.

This helps to see, what is left. It's a different feeling from the way we do like 1, 2, 3 ... so on.

Now after this article with URL 106-trick-to-achieve-a-goal, I know that I have to write 105 more articles to finish this challenge. It gives a completely different feeling from the earlier approach. **It feels like I am getting closer to the goal day by day**.
