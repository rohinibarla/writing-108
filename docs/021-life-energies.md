### Life energies
  
Recently when I saw video footage of how feeble Sadhguru was after the consecration of Dhyanalinga. It's a display of how committed he was for three lifetimes of work. It's an example of extreme commitment. We want to call it extreme because it does not feel sane. But it is commitment. If you're going to really be committed to your vision, just see it and think what all it took to fulfill the commitment. In 8 months, he has aged like 25 years.  
  
When we look Sadhguru, how strong he is.  
  
I felt so overwhelmed with gratitude for the people who are willing to give their life to make Sadhguru's life energies improve. And make Sadhguru's body as it is today. From that fragile state of either Sadhguru stands or sits, a tear in the muscle was happening. With immense gratitude, Namaskaram to all the lotus feet of all these people, who have kept Sadguru. Vibrant like this, for us to sit and listen to him live. These people have offered their life to Sadhguru, Sadhguru is offering his life to all of use.
