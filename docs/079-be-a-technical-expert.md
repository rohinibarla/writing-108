# Be a technical expert
To be a technical expert, you need to be solving all the problems people get stuck on. Understand the problems which take a long time to resolve and find out a systematic way to solve it and refine the process to the local context. 

Unless you write code and see it running live and view in the debugger, how stuff is happening. You donâ€™t really get the sense of command over the specifics of working in the technology.

Create a toy project and understand all the intricate detail. Like mechanisms that enable it to work. Which patterns are used to make it easy for development? Why only this way, they have chosen to do? What are the alternatives? Why did they not choose a better way? What is the context for which this technology was created? That is for which problem they created this technology as a solution? What were the historical dependencies on which this technology has evolved? Where is this technology first practically used? From that point on till now, where else were they used? What were other influences for this technology to become so prevalent today?

As you keep doing this continuously, either experimenting or developing or unblocking people. There will be a compound effect in the overall expertise. As you master one technology in depth. Mastering another technology would become easy since the patterns to understand technology have been created in the process of mastering the first technology.
