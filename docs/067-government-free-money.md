### Government free money
How do you see this workout?
When there are norms to be followed. You can decide what to do with the money that may be a good use. You can get the basics right and then move on to what you wanted to work on. The proposal is to give Rs 70,000/- for each adult per month in the US. i.e., $1000/- but how about we in India need to be comfortable to live with. Each adult gets Rs 10,000/- which would be $150 per month for each adult would be good enough for us to live. It all depends on how you are forced or given a choice to use the money for. If you put some restrictions that you need to buy specific schema and all, then it's like helping the corporates in the whole process.

But coming to the point, that as it does, if the US just prints money and give to their citizens. The citizens use that money to make use of the work of others. It’s like out of thin air you are giving power to their citizens for others to work for them. It’s another new kind of slavery. Which is being created.

When the fundamental way of money creations is dubious, many things become absurd. Just this policy of giving UBI to US citizens is like to make everyone in the rest of the world slaves to their citizens. It all because we all trust the value of the dollar.
