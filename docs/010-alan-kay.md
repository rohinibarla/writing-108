### Alan Kay
  
> The best way to predict the future is to invent it.  
  
When I was reading a book on "Cocoa and Objective-C: Up and Running" written by Scott Stevenson, I came across this quote as part of a string example in Objective-C.  
  
That was one of the introductions of Alan Kay. The vision of Alan Kay about how computing must evolve is interesting and everyone must go through it.  
  
He has worked in Xerox, Apple and runs his own research institute now. His ideas and thoughts have a huge impact on the way of my thinking. In his generation, people who are part of the computer science field are from wide backgrounds, because CS is not established till then. He is a Biology graduate, but had interesting things like communicating between objects, just like the cells communicate.  
  
The objects communicating using messages in Algol and Objective-C, is one of the best paradigms, for software to evolve independently. The majority of the scalable computing models, follow this pattern. Like the actors model in the Play frame in Scala.  
  
His talks in Computer Science History Museum are some good collections to watch.
