# Ground nuts
Who has first identified the ground nuts and started collected for local population use, has to be thanked. There might be many people in many regions doing the same at different times in the history. The person who has done for Telugu people must be thanked for. And the many things that they prepare with these ground nuts is wonderful to eat. There are many dishes which use ground nuts as an part of the preparation. Just frying them and eating was a pass time for many time in childhood as well as in train journeys. 

When there is nothing to eat in the morning along with curd rice, just adding these makes me feel the breakfast super and delicious. Just the raw one in breakfast is enough for me with water, salt and rice to eat with. Nothing else is needed.

The practice of people in north is to soak handful of these nuts at night and eat daily in the morning. Where ever they go, they take them in a handkerchief and eat them when they feel like. That’s decent food to consume.

Similarly on Ekadasi after the fast at the night these soaked nuts are served with bananas. Which is the right food after fasting on that day.

For pregnant ladies they suggest to eat ‘pappu undalu’ made with jaggery and ground nuts. To increase the haemoglobin content in blood. 

There are many incidents to consume these in different ways, fresh from the farm boiled one’s. And many other varieties.

Have some ground nuts at the beach, is a common scene in old movies and in olden days. Not things have adopted to the new ones.

Ooh my dear ground nuts, namaskaram for filling my appetite.
