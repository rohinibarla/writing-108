### Organized notes.

Let your notes not become similar to the internet.

We come across so much useful information these days that we tend to keep collecting notes after notes. 

In my case, I keep on piling up these notes. But never re-check them. It rarely happens. Now I want to change this. Until I process and analyze and synthesis all the notes that I have so far, I will not be collecting or creating new notes. 

Let me have a phase of pruning and putting the things in place. Use the notes and keep them well organized, to go through later. Ideally, I wanted to have a pruning phase or apply phase every weekend. To synthesis all the collected notes in the week. A small categorization at the end of the day and weekend systems will work for me.

Itâ€™s time to put this in practice.
