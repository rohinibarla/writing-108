### Claude Alvares
  
A guy from Goa, running his own independent press. Books from his press are highly recommended for reading. He has homeschooled his three kids. And they are doing well. One of his sons has written a book. It is on his experience exploring Goa in his 10th standard or at the age of 10. It's an excellent book to read.  
  
His talk on Farming and schooling is fun to watch and so many insights. Watch it twice to get all the details from the talk.  
  
His talk on launching Multiversity is another must-watch. How different cultures have lost their wealth of knowledge across the earth, just because of the British rule in different places. How they want to recreate this multicultural knowledge.  
  
I hugely admire him and I bow down to his feet for doing such interesting work for the people.
