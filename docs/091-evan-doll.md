### Evan Doll

Best classes that I have taken...

After the release of the iPhone, around 2008-09, there were some classes taken at Stanford University to build iPhone apps using Objective-C. Two employees took these classes from Apple. One of them is Evan Doll. His style of teaching is tooooo good. Those are the best classes I have seen, someone teaching for beginners in iPhone Application programming on iOS.

Later he started the Flipboard App, which is one of the best apps on iPad to consume the content online, just like a magazine. So a dynamic magazine based on your interests is created. You can subscribe to different people's creations. They flow into your iPad like beautiful magazines.  
  
Now he is back at Apple as the Director of Health Software Engineering. 

He is one of the best people to follow in the Software industry. His writings and everything is good to read. There are more people from the old-Apple camp who are too good to follow â€” people like Bret Victor, Alan Kay, about whom I need to write a different article.
