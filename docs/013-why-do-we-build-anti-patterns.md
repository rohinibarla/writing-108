### Why do we build anti-patterns?

Just now, it rained heavily in Vizag. It was a beautiful play of nature, with thunders, wind and shower.  
  
Seawater is bought to land via clouds by nature. Nature created this massive desalinization system with its intelligence. Humans are creating large holes in this system design. By creating carpeted roads and canals for the rainwater to quickly flush out and reach the sea. Humans are quick in creating such anti-patterns. 90% of the water is just flown back to the sea via canals built by something called Municipality.  
  
Now the groundwater levels are dropped due to this anti-pattern. Municipality comes up with pipelines to supply water. Again from reservoirs build to stop the natural flow of water. Another anti-pattern.  
  
Itâ€™s time we humans realize the disasters that we have created with these anti-patterns. Time to think of new designs and going forward, use the new designs in sync with nature.  
  
Nature will not sync with us. We need to be in sync with nature.
