### Principle to communicate

The goal is to use an optimal way to transfer the idea/intention/bhavam from one head to another with the least amount of distortion.  
  
To do this, we need to first find out the common vocabulary both of us understand and use them. Vocabulary is like naming a mental model. It's like the key to the value. So we all have some intersection between our collections of keys.   
  
Computer science theory is the common vocabulary that we have. We need to use them to the max extent possible to communicate when we work or being part of the interview. We can use words like find, sort, max. Since we all know them it does make the job easy for us in the communication process.  
  
In real life, we need to be keen on what the other person's world view is and his vocabulary is. So we could effectively communicate. User experience design(UXD) is done in the development of software artifacts. Similarly, we need to do "user experience design in communication". We can take these principles from the UXD and apply them in communication. That will lead to better communication.
