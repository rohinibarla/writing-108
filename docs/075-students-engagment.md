### Students engagment
  
When we take courses on Coursera and online course material websites. They usually tend to have the quiz step at each of the 2-5 mins intervals or at the end of the video of length 5-10 mins. This often keeps the student active while learning.  
  
It will be difficult for people to continuously watch the video for longer durations and be active with the content. So having these pauses in the flow and answering questions was interesting.  
  
Similarly, way wanted to experiment with the interview that I plan to conduct. By which it also tells us about the participation of the students. And their engagement and also give a break in the processing of the information in their mind.  
  
The structure of the video's length and questions in Coursera will give more insight into how to design the lectures into appropriate units for people to see.  
  
I need to list the top courses on Coursera and other websites. And see their structure and incorporate it into the environment I create for students to learn.
