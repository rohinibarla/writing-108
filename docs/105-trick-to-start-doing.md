### Trick to start doing

To start doing what you want to do. Like writing or reading or coding or solving a problem or fixing an issue or reaching out to people. Anything that you want to do, can be started using a trick.

The trick is to set a 21-min timmer and just commit for that period to force yourself to start doing it. Things might flow and might not flow in some occasions. The key thing is sticking to the commitment that will keep on thinking or trying until the flow starts. And we are into the process of doing what we need.

The beauty of this method is that it is a short duration, which we can commit with minimal will power. Once we practice this process, we can see good results. We will be surprised to see that it is this simple to start doing what we want to do.

"Wanting to remain in the same state" looks like Newton's first law. So we use this trick as an external force to change the state into the needed activity rolling. Once it is rolling, it's up to us, to continue with another block of 21-mins once the timer kicks in. We can repeat till we feel to continue or we come into a state of flow where this is not needed.

This is called the Promodo technique. It worked for me, I feel this is useful for people who are postponing important things from not starting. Experiment and see if it works for your type of mind.

When we can discipline our faculties like body, mind, and emotion using Inner Engineering, we may not need this. Until we get to a state where we are the master of our faculties, we can use this trick to get into the flow.
