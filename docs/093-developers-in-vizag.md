# Developers in Vizag

Hmm, I am not finding good developers for my startup in Vizag. It's the environment stupid. What is the environment you are providing? Now we have the remote option as well. You want a fool to experiment with you by spending his time. Otherwise, there must be something outstanding thing which is intangible must be able to be achieved for him. Which he needs to understand the value of it. Otherwise, you are not doing your best job is what is felt. If you are full time and dedicated to creating what you wanted. Work with the things you have. Do what you can. Remote, colleges, and other things. You have to work hard. There is no free lunch. Someone is feeding on behalf of you.
