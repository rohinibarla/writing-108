### App development or Problem-solving

With the recession of the IT industry, the way of hiring is changing to better standards. With each problem the industry encounters, the industry raises the bar close to the reality bar needed to work in the software world. It has been the trend in the industry. On average, every 4 years, they move the bar closer to reality.  
  
Can you speak and communicate well with confidence? Ok, get into the software world. That used to be the bar. After hiring, they used to train them and quickly, these people are moved to team lead roles so that they don't need to expose their poor coding skills.  

Around 4 years back, it has changed and companies started looking for coding skills along with communication. Now, can you solve these problems? Write code for these questions was the check to take into the company.  
  
Now with the advent of all the resources available, they are expecting the students to do some projects. That is, are they capable of creating software? Even for an internship, now companies are asking, have you done any projects. I did not develop any software, but I am good at problem-solving, give me any problem, I will solve it. I have been practicing this, through all my B.Tech years.  
  
For the industry, from their experience, it has been clear that the correlation between people who are good at competitive coding and who are good in developing software is less than 10%. Not only that, when you see students just becoming good at solving interview questions and nothing good about creating software. You doubt, do the student is interested in software development or all he wants is just a job.  
  
There is a massive difference between the people who are interested in creating software and the people who are interested in a job. Even both are having the same capabilities, the first one will be the best performer in the company. Because creating anything to the level of usable by the customers, needs a lot of effort. Out of the total product/project development, it takes 20% time to complete 80% of the development and 80% of the time to complete 20% of the final stabilization and fixing out loose ends and make it work best for the customer. So unless you are interested in creating the software, it is hard to put the effort for the last 20% work to complete.  
  
Many people are good at doing 80% of the work, but very few people are good at doing the finishing work of the last 20%. So even though you have a bunch of developers who are good at problem-solving, they usually get stuck at the end. The product will have stability problems, which they cannot debug and fix. In a way, causing the product to be not used well. In that way, it hampers the primary purpose of the software creation, that is to be used by customers.  
  
Irrespective of a recession time or not, it is always the right thing to do is to create software for the problems that you get interested in. Though out your B.Tech, you need to be building software at every stage, with solving some interesting (for you) problems. In that way, you understand many system-level details of how software in the real world works end to end and how it is used.  
  
From my personal experience, when you parallelly work on exciting projects in your B.Tech, your understanding of the subjects is much more profound. And it will be entirely at a higher level than others who are learning for marks.
