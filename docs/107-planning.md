### Plan to execute

This pattern is repeating. I tend to plan how to execute. But fail mostly with the same pattern of 
- doing some initial planning.
- in between some thinking
- final the day arrives
- with little clarity and 
- lots of open ends
- start executing on the go
  
This has happened many times. Only when I repeat something, I have some list of sub-activity details. But not forming a proper ordered list of activities to achieve the desired objective.  
  
Two days to go, tomorrow is already occupied, only today is there to plan. This state I have experienced much time. How can I make sure this does not repeat itself.  
  
#### Some possible solutions:

##### Solution#1:
- When you accept an activity, spend an immediately available full day on it.
- next following 5 days with a minimum of 2 hours, spending to build the plan with details. 
- next following 5 days with a minimum of 1 hour to take feedback and update it regularly.

##### Solution#2:
- Come-up with a rough plan in the next 1 hour.
- Get it reviewed and collect feedback.
- Come-up with a semi-detailed plan spending half a day.
- Get it reviewed and collect feedback.
- Come-up with a detailed plan spends the next available 2 days on it.
  
#### Solution for this time:
Make use of the first session to understand what they want to do and what they know.  
It's like where they want to go and where they are.  
Some interesting activities and presentations by people.  
The ideation session is one, that we can run.  

I feel the second solution will work for the type of work I am doing. It's not new and I have thought of many things earlier. For a project in a new area, I can use the first solution.
