### Adi Shankaracharya Jayanthi

Why do we celebrate the birthdays of people who are not alive?  
  
We celebrate birthdays of a few of all those people who have once walked this land. How do we identify those few? The people who have an immense effect on us and the ways we live.   
  
It‚Äôs interesting to see Adhi Shankaracharya has lived only until 32 years of age. With such a short life, when you look at his works, it‚Äôs something the mind cannot understand. That he could walk the land of Bharat, multiple times by just walking. And he has done an enormous amount of work, which could influence us after thousands of years.  
  
Many of his writings are well sung today. I am interested in his Stotrams. My mind sinks so well in his Nirvana Shatakam.   
  
Chidhanandha Rupa Shivoham, Shivoham.   
  
I bow down üôè with immense gratitude to him on his birthday.  
Panchami, Shukla Paksha, Vaisakha Masam.
