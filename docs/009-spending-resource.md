### Spending resource
  
How I spend my always-available resource?  
  
Time is an interesting resource, always available, just ticking and we cannot accumulate it. Actually, it’s not the time that is ticking, it’s my life that is ticking away. So let’s design a model about how to spend this interesting resource.  
  
Here I want a process in place, which enhances me in all dimensions. Dimensions which all I consider worth having.  
  
Spending an hour and a half for Sadhana in the morning. Spending an hour in the lap of the earth. Spending 15 mins thinking about how to improve in a specific dimension. Like for example: How to earn? I write for 15 mins. And use anything useful that comes out. Writing article for 30 mins. Work for 4 hours. Spend an hour with family and friends. Evening Sadhana for an hour. All these combine for 10 hours.  Another 2 hours for maintaining the body, like eating and cleaning.  
  
So there are 12 hours left, for sleep and some buffer time. Once travel comes into play, this gets reduced to 8 hours.  
  
This looks good enough process to start and follow. As time goes on, I want to put each one of these different ways of spending time into a habit, consistent and regular.
