### The environment

Gene is the cause.  
The virus is the cause.  
Youtube is the cause.  
  
People try to associate many of the health problems with genes. But in reality, the environment plays an essential role in enabling these genes.

You have the best genes to develop software, but you were born 5000 years ago. What's the point. It's the potential energy unless you find an environment to express it. You don't see the use of all the potential. 

Similarly, to evade the real cause, people use genes as the primary cause of a lack of education. Instead of govt doing its best to set up and continuously evolve the environment, it tends to find genes as the reason for people not able to study well. But if you go fact-checking, they impact 2% of the overall. And in that, these 4 genes affect 98% percent. So it's effect is 1.96% overall. So it's a minor effect, projected as the overall with percentages in the media created titles.

The tobacco industry tried to make genes as the cause of cancer to evade the things that are being created.

Similarly, viruses are used to make the world shift their attention. To avoid public attention. From all the wrong things being done by corporates, governments, and the people with immense power, who feel less responsible for the wrong things they are intentionally doing.

It's the environment stupid.

Oh, my child is addicted to youtube. How can I stop it? Please don't try to stop it. Instead, focus on creating the environment in which the desire to watch youtube is reduced to a minimum. You can take to the beach, park, hills and many games which can make you fill with full using your body and mind. Use it or lose it applies to the mind, body, and everything in general. So our goal must be to create an environment and keep evolving it to make use of the child's mind and body to the best. Expose to the best things that you know. Make them collectively do something or the other. Start a center for people to come and play and create some exciting stuff, whatever they like with the material available.

Oh, my employees are not productive. Do you create an environment for the developers to focus on undisturbed continuous chunks of a long time like 4-8 hours of uninterrupted time blocks for them to work? Better work on the environment than trying to fix it.

Oh, my mind is not doing what I want. Don't control the mind. Start committing to things and start executing things. See what environment you have created around. Try to understand the effect and make the environment such that it helps in doing the things that you wanted to do with less friction.  And to do something that you don't want to as much friction as needed, try to add it. It must be very hard to do the things that you don't want to do.

**It's the environment stupid.**
