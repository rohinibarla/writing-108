In life, I came across a few people who tell to focus on health rather than medicine/disease. People like Dr. Khader Valli, Dr. B.M. Hegde, Sadhguru tell us to focus on strengthening our immune system.  

Each one proposes different solutions to strengthen our immune system.  
Dr. Khadhar Valli focuses on natural food, kashaya, lifestyle, mind and homeopathic medicine.  
Dr. B.M Hegde focuses on food, mind, and looking at the value of traditional food habits.  
Sadhguru focuses on yogic science methods like food (neem, turmeric, pepper, honey), mantras and kriyas.  

In these challenging times, Sadhguru has suggested two things to improve the immune strength and specifically to increase the strength of lungs.  

One is “Yoga Yoga Yogeshwaraya” chant.

The second one is a simple Kriya, which takes less than 5 mins to do. Today when I did this in the morning, my experience is wonderful. Which triggered me to write this and share it with you. **Dear friend, just try just this one thing for one day, if you don’t like it leave it.**  
Here is [Simha Kriya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP1Y1bk1YgU) - A Simple but Powerful Yogic Process to Boost Immunity and Enhance Lung Capacity.

The beauty of this Kriya is it strengthens our lungs. And immunity as well. And it is a simple diagnostic tool if we have any problem in the lungs. This was explicitly suggested for doctors who are handling Covid patients. But you and I can use it for our benefit.  

Let us keep strengthening our immune system and behave cautiously and carefully not to come in contact with the virus and spread it.
