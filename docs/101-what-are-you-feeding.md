### What are you feeding?

We are good at measuring tangible things. We can measure and decide. To have a well-working body, we need to see what we are feeding ourselves. When we improve the quality of the input and quality of the way we intake, it will enhance our body and mind. We need to check the raw material being used to build this body.  
  
When it comes to the things which we cannot measure and observe with casual attention are subtler. These subtle things decide the majority of what we do and what we become. The more control we have on little things in life, the more we direct our life.  
  
The way we sit, stand, and walk decides many things. These are subtle things. The way we breathe. Our system is structured to work in a specific way. When we work out against this system design for an extended period, it creates friction in the system. This friction is what we call unhealthy.   
  
When we start to observe "what is feeding into the system at an instruction level?". The thoughts in the environment that we expose ourselves. The self-talk that we make. These are different levels of friction, which causes more problems than physical resistance.  
  
When we move further into subtler things, we come to the things that we believe as real. When we can align with the truth, instead of beliefs and false notions, we can be at peace. For example, when we believe like death is for others. Other people die; it's not for us. But when we align with the truth, we know that we may die today. It's so much uncertain. When we come to terms with these uncertainties in life, there is no uncertainty in life.   
  
When you truly understand there is no security in life, that is when you can truly feel secure. Till then, you try to do many things to make a secured-life. It's like trying to achieve something against the truth. It is a wasted effort when you can enjoy and be happy once you accept "the truth."  
  
As the saying goes, garbage in garbage out.  
  
So we need to be aware of what we are feeding ourselves and try to improve the input. And be aware of the truth. Let's joy blossom in our lives.
