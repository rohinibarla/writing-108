### Clarity of mind

When you feel non-energetic. You don't know what's the reason for the current state of mind. When I face such situations, I open up a full-screen editor and start writing whatever comes to my mind. As I keep pouring things from my mind, the brain gets a bit empty. And I could see the reason for any disturbed state. 

This process helped me in many states. The reason for this sate might be the thought that which goes in loops at this stage. And we cannot figure out the core reason for these states. 

This process makes you focus on the activity of dumping everything from the mind. This focus will make the noisy cyclical thoughts stop. The output is at your face starring to look at the cause of this state. And Now from the state of a feeling victim of the mind's halla-gulla and hall-chall. You come to a state where you direct the mind to find out the reason and sort out what needs to be done to get rid of the reason that is causing a nuisance.

The simple trick is to write down all and see.
