### Dictation

Nice to see this. Now we can write without typing, with ease. Maybe my pronunciation will improve by using this dictation instead of typing. I need to experiment with this technology to make it convenient for my usage. There might be some issues but need to figure out how to work around them. This hover indicator is not moving along the typing line. This might be a problem with the application as well, or we can verify this by using it in several applications. When we run the same in Grammarly, it would be interesting to see how both these applications built using AI will make the whole process.

Once you have a calm room, this interface might be handy and help you get rid of the physical stress that you get on the hands. When this works on code editors as well, it would be fascinating.
