### Deep problem in the system

When someone cleans the beach by collecting all the alcohol bottles thrown by people at night. We see him as a great person, doing social good.  

Fundamentally there is something wrong at the core of the system. Why do people who throw these waste enjoy their way in such a manner? Why does someone who collects all these, also enjoys the activity for social praise? Letâ€™s say no one praises this cleaning, will you still do it?  

Why do we litter the earth in so many ways? Why do we create things which do not disintegrate? But why should people litter in the first place? How can we create a social structure and system where you naturally do not litter.  

Swatch Bharath is one such activity, which tried to address this primary cause of all these problems of waste all over the place.  To change the attitude of people. But still, we could not change all the people in the society. What else can be done to change this attitude?  

Now you cannot pass urine on the side of a public road. At least you are ashamed of. Do we need to shame these people? Is this the best way. How to make them conscious that earth to be kept clean. Something has to be done. Conduct an ideation session to address this problem.
