### Gynecologist's role for a better world

There are many practices that used to be followed by conceived women in ancient days. These practices were bought after careful observation of how the human system is built starting from the 2 cells.  
  
They say that life enters between 42-48 days into the womb. What does life entering into the body means? Why does it take 9 months? How many months does it take for a cow, monkey and other earthlings? Because of the Earth, Moon, and Sun, we have these forms. Are they also influencing the duration of 9 months?  
  
Definitely the mother's body, mind, emotions, energy, and environment around her influence the growth of the baby. What are the different mechanisms to keep these five things in an optimal state for the best growth of the baby?  
  
Even the sounds around influence the baby. What type of sounds is best for the baby?  
  
Ancient times based on our climate conditions they suggested to have specific food. What are the reasons for it? Can we dig into different sources and understand the reasons and bring back the practices which make sense in today's context.  
  
SSY conducts programs for mothers and fathers during this period. Isha also has a program for women during this period. What do they do in their programs? What is the effect due to these practices that are suggested? Can we dig deeper and understand their reasoning behind. At the minimum can we clearly capture the practices that are suggested. Staying in consecrated spaces will surely help. Where are consecrated spaces around us and how can we create such spaces?   
  
Just coming a few years before and reading some books does not make something into great and arrogant beings. We bully the kids but are also full-fledged life just like us. Just that we are ahead in the line to be born and to be dead.   
  
All these wonderful practices not part of the prescription of medicines. But surely suggesting the right practices and the care for the baby inside the womb by the doctor is a sure sign of respect and responsibility for the future generation.  
  
In this rat race environment, does the doctor have time to even take an extra breath to relax? No. But these working lifestyles are created unknowingly or accepted as given. Even in this rat race, if it's about you getting ahead of other doctors. It's time you care your best for the child in you visiting moms' womb. Which will surely send the right signal to the parents and they will queue outside your clinic, for your care. If you just care only for the number of transactions made, then what to say? Only to wish you all the best for having a better version rat-like life.
