# Connect to the audience

One of the best ways to connect to your audience is by creating newsletters. Anything that you create regularly, you can make it reach your audience with a simple newsletter, which would keep them updated with the things that they like.

Here the newsletters are subscribed by people who like what you say. So instead of pushing and asking your friends and family to listen to your excellent knowledge that you acquired. It's better to put it over into the bits and let the people who want to listen to you, hear what you say.  

The newsletter is a perfect fit, and it will lead to the opportunities that will allow your expression in the domains that you like. It will also lead to connecting to people with whom you can achieve higher (with your measuring stick) things.

Newsletters are the best way to connect to people who are interested in the things that you say and write.
